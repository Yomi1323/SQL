CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.




CREATE TABLE posts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_name TEXT,
    content TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO posts (user_name, content) VALUES ('Alice', 'Hello, world!');
INSERT INTO posts (user_name, content) VALUES ('Bob', 'This is my first post.');
INSERT INTO posts (user_name, content) VALUES ('Charlie', 'I love SQL!');

-- Update the content of the post with id 2

UPDATE posts SET content = 'This is my updated post.' WHERE id = 2;

-- Delete the post with id 3

DELETE FROM posts WHERE id = 3;
